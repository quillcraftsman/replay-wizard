# Governance

## Project Roles

- **Maintainers**: Individuals responsible for overseeing the project's development, 
merging contributions, and ensuring adherence to project standards.
- **Contributors**: Individuals who actively participate in the project by submitting code, documentation, 
or other valuable contributions.
- **Community Managers**: Individuals responsible for community engagement, handling issues, organizing events, 
and fostering a positive environment.
- **Reviewers**: Individuals responsible for code reviews, ensuring the quality and adherence to project 
standards before merging contributions.

## Decision-Making Processes

- **Consensus-Based Decision-Making**: Major decisions are made through discussion, and consensus is reached 
among maintainers and contributors.
- **Voting**: Certain decisions might involve voting among project members, with a majority determining the outcome.
- **Benevolent Dictatorship**: A single individual (usually the project founder) makes final decisions, 
often with input from the community.
